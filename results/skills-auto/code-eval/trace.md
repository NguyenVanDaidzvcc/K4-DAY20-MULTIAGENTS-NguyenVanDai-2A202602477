### Human
The test suite of the `bookings` package in the folder `workspace/` is failing.

Fix the source code so that the whole test suite passes and every function does what its docstring says.
The visible tests do not cover everything: the docstrings are the specification.
Do not modify the existing files in `tests/`.
Your changes are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme Python team conventions.

When you are done, reply with a short summary of what you changed and why.


Execution requirements: Read the workspace README, task specifications, and relevant source/docstrings before implementation. Use the documented formats and semantics rather than guessing. For data transformations, write a Python script using write_file and execute it with python. Read the complete input programmatically; do not transcribe preview rows or estimate results mentally. Prefer standard-library modules and Decimal for monetary arithmetic, preserving the required output units. Keep imports at module scope. After a failed command, read the traceback and the current affected function before editing. If a patch fails or the same error recurs, replace the complete affected function from its current contents instead of repeating an ineffective edit. Before finishing, execute validation: reopen each required output file, check schema, types and counts against the available instructions, and run the relevant tests for code changes. Fix concrete validation failures. Only claim outputs that exist and

1. Identify all public functions (names not starting with '_') and add type annotations on all parameters and return values.
2. Fix bugs by reading the input and specification, implementing the correct logic, writing outputs, reopening and validating them, and fixing concrete failures.
3. For CSV output functions, ensure proper quoting of fields containing commas or double quotes by wrapping them in double quotes and escaping internal quotes as per CSV standards.
4. For price parsing, handle all documented formats including accounting-style negatives (parentheses) and thousands separators.
5. For rounding monetary values, use half-up rounding as specified.
6. Add a regression test file `tests/test_regressions.py` with one test function per bug fixed; ensure this file passes all tests.
7. Record each fix in `CHANGELOG.md` under the heading '## Unreleased' as a bullet with the format `- fix(<function name>): <short description>`.
8. Do not modify original test files in `tests/`; new test files are allowed.
9. Run the full test suite after changes to verify all tests pass.
10. Stop after all failures are fixed and tests pass.

description: Use when parsing log files to extract error entries, normalize service names, timestamps, and produce sorted error reports with repeat counts.

1. Read the entire log file and parse each entry line by line.
2. Normalize service names to lower-case with hyphens replaced by underscores (e.g., payment-service → payment_service).
3. Filter entries to include only those with level ERROR or CRITICAL (case-insensitive).
4. Parse timestamps with timezone awareness, convert all to UTC naive datetime, and format as ISO 8601 strings with 'Z' suffix (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
5. Extract the message text following the service name and level.
6. For entries with tracebacks, capture the last line of the traceback as the `exception` field; if no traceback, set `exception` to null.
7. Detect and sum repeated messages indicated by lines like `-- last message repeated N times --` immediately following an entry; set `repeat_count` to 1 plus repeats.
8. Aggregate counts of errors by normalized service name.
9. Sort the final errors list by service name ascending, then by timestamp_utc ascending.
10. Write output JSON to `workspace/errors.json` with top-level keys: `"schema_version": 2`, `"generated_by": "log-triage"`, `"errors": [...]`, and `"counts_by_service": {...}`.
11. Verify the output file exists and matches all schema and sorting requirements.
12. Stop after writing and validating the output.

1. Read the data dictionary before processing to understand all field formats and keys.
2. Parse every documented date format explicitly: use `datetime.strptime` for slash dates (e.g. '%d/%m/%Y'), and `dateutil.parser.isoparse` or `datetime.fromisoformat` for ISO-8601 timestamps.
3. Convert all timezone-aware datetimes to UTC and format as naive UTC datetime strings in ISO 8601 format with 'Z' suffix (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).
4. Deduplicate rows by the documented identity key (e.g., order_id), keeping the first occurrence.
5. Count missing values before filtering; exclude rows with missing or invalid amounts (e.g., amount = -999).
6. Normalize region names to canonical spelling exactly: North, South, East, West.
7. Convert all monetary values to integer cents (e.g., 1606.67 USD → 160667) in both JSON aggregates and cleaned CSV cells.
8. Write cleaned CSV output to `workspace/clean.csv` with exact header and column order: `order_id,timestamp_utc,region,amount_cents`.
9. Include one row per distinct record with a known amount.

### Assistant
I have identified several issues in the source code that cause the test suite to fail and do not meet the docstring specifications:

1. In `billable_blocks` (bookings/billing.py):
   - The function uses `round()` which rounds to the nearest integer, but the docstring requires always rounding up (ceiling).
   - It does not check for negative `minutes` to raise `ValueError`.

2. In `add_slot` (bookings/schedule.py):
   - The function uses a mutable default argument `slots=[]`, which causes state sharing between calls.
   - The docstring requires that separate calls do not share state, so a new list must be created each time.

3. In `parse_duration` (bookings/timeutil.py):
   - The function only supports the "XhYm" format.
   - The docstring lists multiple supported formats ("1h30m", "2h", "45m", "1:30", "45").
   - The function should support all these formats and parse them correctly.

I will fix these three functions accordingly with proper type annotations, correct logic, and docstring compliance. Then I will run the tests again.

### Assistant
I fixed three functions according to their docstrings and test requirements:

- bookings/billing.py: billable_blocks now raises ValueError for negative minutes and always rounds up using ceiling division.
- bookings/schedule.py: add_slot no longer uses a mutable default argument; it creates a new list each call to avoid shared state.
- bookings/timeutil.py: parse_duration now supports all documented formats ("1h30m", "2h", "45m", "1:30", "45") with proper regex matching and parsing.

All tests in the visible test suite pass now. The functions behave exactly as specified in their docstrings.
